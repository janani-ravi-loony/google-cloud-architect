############# NOTES

# Routes in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are a fundamental component of the networking within Google Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). They define the paths that network traffic should take from one entity to another within or outside of your VPC. Here are key details about routes in GCP:

# Purpose: Routes are used to direct network traffic between VM instances, the internet, and other networks. They determine how data packets travel from their source to their destination.

# Types of Routes:

# System-generated routes: Automatically created when you create a VPC. These routes manage traffic within the network and to the internet.
# Custom routes: Created by users to handle specific traffic patterns, such as routing certain traffic through a VPN or to specific external addresses.


# Gateway

# In Google Cloud Platform's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), each subnet has an automatically allocated gateway IP address, typically the first usable IP address in the subnet range. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about the gateway in a VPC subnet:

# Function: The gateway serves as the default route for devices within the subnet that need to communicate with other subnets or the internet. It acts as an intermediary to forward outbound traffic from instances in the subnet to other destinations.

Allow HTTP - check the checkbox


# Click Advanced options -> Networking

network: loony-auto-vpc
network service tier: Standard

# Click on Advanced Options -> Management 

# Paste this code on the Startup script textbox

# Notes

# Network Address: 10.128.0.0/20
# Subnet Mask: /20, which corresponds to 255.255.240.0 in dotted decimal notation.
# This subnet mask indicates that the first 20 bits of the IP address are fixed for network identification, and the remaining 12 bits are used for host addresses.

# In typical network setups, including those in cloud environments like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), specific IP addresses within any subnet are reserved for special purposes:

# Network Address (10.128.0.0): The first address of any subnet, in your case 10.128.0.0, is the network address. It is used to identify the subnet itself and is not assignable to individual devices. This address is crucial for network routing purposes as it represents the entire network segment.

# Gateway Address (10.128.0.1): Often, the first usable address in the subnet, following the network address, is assigned as the default gateway. In GCP, and many other networks, this address is used for the router or gateway that manages traffic between this subnet and other networks. This gateway is essential for enabling communication between the VMs in the subnet and the internet or other virtual networks within GCP.

# The IP address 10.128.0.1 would typically be the default gateway through which your VM at 10.128.0.2 would communicate with other networks outside its local subnet.
